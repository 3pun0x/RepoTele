# RepoTele - Hunting Abused Telegram Accounts

The following is a part of my talk called "Leveraging Yara Rules to Hunt for Abused Telegram Accounts", that script is the second step in my research to hunt for malicious Telegram accounts using Telethon. To perform its activity, the script gets a config file with Phone Number, Telegram API ID, and HASH which you can create through the Telegram API website. The next mandatory step is to input the script with a list of Telegram Accounts to scan. 

## Prerequisites
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
* [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon)
* [Telegram API](https://my.telegram.org/auth)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the project
2. Add Telethon library
3. Get your Telegram api_id and api_hash through Telegram API website
3. Create config file in CSV format by order of "[phoneNum],[api_id],[api_hash]"
4. Create a TXT file named "file_telegram_names.txt" with the list of Telegram accounts to scan
5. Execute the script using Python3
```
Python3 RepoTele.py
```
6. Import the 'output.csv' to Google Sheets to read the file clearly.
